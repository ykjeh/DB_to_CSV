This script was created for a Windows 98 project, where you can connect to a MySQL database and execute queries to export data from the columns. 
The data will be exported to a TXT file in CSV format. 

This TXT file can be used to open a database in Windows 98, for example. 
However, it can also be used in other cases where it is necessary to export a database to a TXT file, or even just to extract your query results.
